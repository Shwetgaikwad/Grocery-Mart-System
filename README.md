# Grocery-Mart-System
Hibernate Grocery Mart System with HQL and HCQL  I developed a simple but effective Hibernate Grocery Mart System using HQL and HCQL. This system enables users to perform CRUD operations on grocery items, such as adding, deleting, updating, and retrieving items. The system also provides a user-friendly interface for managing grocery lists.
